## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains the notes, code examples, and supplementary materials I used while serving as a Lab Demonstrator for the **Computing in Statistics** module. The primary goal is to provide a clear, reproducible, and well-documented resource for educational purposes.

The materials are built using **Quarto**, a modern scientific and technical publishing system, and primarily use the **R** programming language.
